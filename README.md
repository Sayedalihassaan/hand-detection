Project Name: Hand Detection Computer Vision

Description:

This project implements real-time hand detection and tracking using computer vision techniques. It captures video from your webcam, identifies hands within the frames, and visualizes them using appropriate drawing methods. Choose between using OpenCV or MediaPipe (your choice) for the processing.


Installation:

Option 1: Using OpenCV

Install OpenCV (pip install opencv-python).
Optionally install additional dependencies from requirements.txt if needed.
Option 2: Using MediaPipe

Install MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe).
Optionally install additional dependencies from requirements.txt if needed.


Libraries Used:

OpenCV (optional)
MediaPipe (optional)
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)


Further Notes:

Choose One Library: Specify the preferred library (OpenCV or MediaPipe) and adjust installation instructions and dependencies accordingly.
Code Clarity: Provide clear and well-commented code that showcases the core functionalities.
Testing: Integrate unit and/or integration tests for code robustness and reliability.
Documentation: Consider adding detailed documentation (e.g., in docs/) to explain algorithms, usage, and potential issues.
Advanced Features: If applicable, mention capabilities like gesture recognition, hand landmark localization, and more.
Community Engagement: Encourage contributions through clear contribution guidelines and active response to issues/pull requests.
